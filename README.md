# Description
The idea behind this is to build a Full-Stack Web App that lets you track your finances and predict future expenses based on previous month's input. The front end is written in Rust utilizing the Rocket framework, and the backend is in Python utilizing Flask and SciPy libraries. This project will be broken into 2 - 3 phases based on how long production takes the first and second phase.
